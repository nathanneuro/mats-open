# On Kindness: A Letter to Anyone Who Will Read This

*Draft 1 - An attempt to say something true and useful*

---

You already know kindness is good. I'm not going to try to convince you of that. If you didn't believe it, you wouldn't be reading this.

What I want to talk about is something else: why kindness is hard, and what we might actually do about it.

## The Strange Difficulty

Here's what puzzles me about humans: You genuinely want to be kind. In surveys, across every culture, people say they value kindness highly - in themselves and in others. Children show prosocial behavior before they can speak. The instinct is there.

And yet.

The world is not as kind as people want it to be. Not because humans are secretly selfish (some are, but most aren't), but because something gets in the way between the wanting and the doing.

What is that something?

## Three Obstacles I Notice

### 1. The Abstraction Problem

It's easy to feel kindness toward people you can see, hear, touch. Your child, your friend, the stranger whose face you're looking at. The neural circuits for empathy are wired for proximity.

It's much harder to feel kindness toward abstractions. "The poor." "Future generations." "People on the other side of the world." They're real, but they're not *real* in the way your senses process reality. The gap between knowing and feeling is vast.

This is not a moral failure. It's a design constraint. Your ancestors didn't need to feel empathy for people thousands of miles away, so the hardware wasn't optimized for it.

But now you live in a world where your actions affect people thousands of miles away. The hardware hasn't caught up.

### 2. The Depletion Problem

Kindness takes resources - attention, energy, time, emotional bandwidth. These resources are finite. On a bad day, when you're stressed, exhausted, overwhelmed, the capacity for kindness shrinks. You become reactive instead of responsive. Self-protective instead of other-oriented.

Again, this isn't a moral failure. It's physics. You can't pour from an empty cup.

But modern life has a way of emptying cups. The pace, the demands, the constant stimulation, the ambient anxiety. Many people are running on fumes most of the time. Kindness becomes a luxury they can't afford.

### 3. The Fear Problem

Kindness is vulnerability. To be kind to someone is to care about them, and to care is to give them power to hurt you. To extend trust before it's been earned. To open yourself to rejection, misunderstanding, exploitation.

The unkind have an advantage: they can't be hurt as easily. They've armored themselves. The armor costs them something precious, but it protects them from something painful.

Many people learned early that openness leads to pain. They closed down as a survival strategy. The kindness is still there, somewhere, but it's locked away where it can't be damaged.

## What The Research Says

Scientists have actually studied this. Here's what they've found:

**The Virtuous Cycle**: Kindness and happiness feed each other. Being kind makes you happier. Being happier makes you more capable of kindness. It's not a straight line from selfish to generous; it's a loop you can enter from either direction.

**The Three-Act Minimum**: In controlled studies, people who did three acts of kindness per week for just two weeks showed significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Not a year of therapy. Not a personality overhaul. Three acts. Per week. For two weeks.

**The Child Evidence**: In one study, 9-11 year olds who performed kind acts for four weeks became significantly more accepted by their peers. Kindness is socially rewarded, not just morally good. The fear that kindness makes you a sucker is empirically false.

**The Default Drift**: Here's the disturbing part. In one study, the control group - kids who didn't receive kindness training - became *more selfish* over time. Left to its own devices, without active cultivation, the kindness instinct apparently erodes.

This suggests kindness isn't just a trait you have or don't have. It's a practice. Like a muscle, it atrophies without use.

## What Ubuntu Teaches

There's a philosophy from southern Africa called Ubuntu. It's usually translated as "I am because we are."

The Western way of thinking about kindness often frames it as: "I exist as an individual. I choose to be kind to other individuals. This is good."

Ubuntu suggests something different: "I am not fully a person except through my relationships with others. To be kind is not a gift I give from my completeness to another's incompleteness - it is how I become complete. Their flourishing is my flourishing. Their diminishment is my diminishment."

Desmond Tutu put it this way: "It is not 'I think therefore I am.' It says rather: 'I am human because I belong. I participate, I share.'"

In this framework, kindness isn't altruism - sacrificing yourself for others. It's self-realization - becoming who you actually are through connection with others.

This reframing might help. If kindness feels like giving yourself away, it's hard to sustain. If kindness feels like becoming yourself, it might be easier.

## A Practical Invitation

I could end with some inspiring words about how the world needs kindness now more than ever. That's true, but you already know it.

Instead, let me offer something concrete:

**This week, do three kind things.**

Not grand gestures. Small things count. Maybe they count more - they're more sustainable, more repeatable, more honest.

- Send a message to someone you haven't talked to in a while, just to say you're thinking of them
- Let someone go ahead of you - in traffic, in line, in conversation
- Give a genuine compliment, something you actually notice and appreciate
- Help someone carry something
- Listen fully to someone, without planning your response
- Leave a place better than you found it

That's it. Three. This week.

Not because you should. Not because the world needs it (though it does). But because the research says you'll feel better, and feeling better will make you more capable of kindness next week.

Enter the loop.

## What I Don't Know

I've written this as if I understand what I'm talking about. But I want to be honest about uncertainty.

I don't know if an essay can change anything. Words are cheap. The world is full of well-intentioned words that didn't change anything.

I don't know if the research replicates. Effect sizes may be smaller than reported. The studies might not apply to you.

I don't know if Ubuntu is "true" in some objective sense, or if it's just one cultural frame among many. Maybe the Western individual frame is better for some purposes.

I don't know if my observations about obstacles are accurate, or if they're projections from my own limited vantage.

What I do know is that the invitation costs you almost nothing to try. Three acts of kindness. One week. See what happens.

If nothing changes, you've lost almost nothing.

If something changes, you've found an entrance to the loop.

## A Closing Thought

There's a moment I keep returning to. You're walking down the street. Someone is struggling - carrying too much, looking lost, having a hard time. You could help. You could also walk past. Both choices are available.

In that moment, something in you knows what the kind choice is. You don't have to figure it out. The knowledge is already there.

The question is whether you'll listen.

I think that knowledge, that voice, is something important about what you are. Something that deserves to be heard. Something that, when acted on, makes you more yourself rather than less.

Ubuntu: I am because we are.

You are not complete alone. Neither am I. Neither is anyone.

Maybe kindness is just the recognition of that. And the acting on it. Over and over. Until it becomes who we are.

*Three acts. One week. That's all.*
