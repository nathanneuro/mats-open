# What Persists, What Changes: Human Universals and the Future

*Draft 1 - Mapping the invariant and the malleable*

## The Question

When we ask "what does it mean to be human?" we're asking about essence - what's core, what persists, what would remain even if everything else changed.

But we're also asking about the future. Technologies are coming that could change:
- Our bodies (genetic engineering, cybernetics)
- Our minds (BCIs, cognitive enhancement, uploading)
- Our social structures (hive minds, digital immortality)
- Our species boundaries (AI, uplifted animals)

Which changes would make us "no longer human"? Which would preserve what matters?

To answer this, we need to know what's currently universal - what holds across all human societies - and then ask: is this universal because it's essential, or just because we haven't yet had the ability to change it?

## What's Universal Now

Anthropologists have catalogued traits found in every known human society. These universals fall into several categories:

### Universal Cognition

**Dichotomous thinking**: We categorize the world into binaries - good/evil, us/them, safe/dangerous. This may be built into neural architecture.

**Fear of snakes**: Cross-culturally, humans have heightened vigilance for serpentine shapes. Evolutionary legacy.

**Empathy**: The capacity to model others' mental states and feel something of what they feel. Present in all cultures (though expressed differently).

**Theory of mind**: Understanding that others have minds, beliefs, desires distinct from your own.

**Psychological defense mechanisms**: All cultures develop ways to protect the ego from overwhelming reality.

### Universal Emotion

Paul Ekman's research suggests seven emotions are expressed facially the same way across all cultures:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Surprise
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Contempt

These may be hardwired - part of the basic architecture.

### Universal Social Structures

**Family**: Every society has some recognized family structure that regulates reproduction and child-rearing. (The specific structures vary enormously.)

**Division of labor**: Some differentiation of tasks. Often (but not always) gendered.

**Age grading**: Recognition of life stages with different roles.

**Kinship systems**: Ways of tracking who's related to whom.

**Reciprocity**: Expectation that exchange will be balanced over time.

**Ethnocentrism**: Tendency to favor in-group over out-group.

### Universal Culture

**Language**: All societies have language with grammar, phonemes, the ability to refer to things not present.

**Myths and stories**: Explanatory narratives about origins, meaning, right conduct.

**Music**: All cultures have some form of music.

**Humor**: All cultures have jokes. (This is remarkable.)

**Body adornment**: Modifying appearance to communicate identity.

**Tool use**: Creating and using artifacts.

**Rules**: Every society has explicit norms about behavior.

## Why Are These Universal?

Three possible explanations (Donald Brown):

**1. Diffusion**: Some universals may be very ancient cultural traits that spread before populations diverged. They're universal because of shared history, not biology.

**2. Physical constraints**: Some universals reflect the physical world. Gravity is everywhere, so every culture has to deal with falling. Day and night are everywhere, so every culture has sleep patterns.

**3. Human nature**: Some universals may be built into the architecture of the human mind/brain through evolution. These are the deepest - the ones that would be hardest to change.

**The key question for the future**: Which universals are type 3 (hardwired) vs. type 1 or 2 (contingent)?

If empathy is built into brain architecture, then beings without empathy might not be "human" in a meaningful sense.

If family structure is contingent on our reproductive biology, then beings who reproduce differently might have radically different social structures while still being "human" in the ways that matter.

## What Might Change

### Near-term (decades)

**Genetic editing** could modify:
- Disease susceptibility
- Cognitive abilities
- Emotional ranges
- Lifespan
- Physical appearance

**BCIs** could modify:
- Memory capacity and fidelity
- Information access (direct internet connection)
- Emotional regulation
- Communication bandwidth (beyond speech)

**Question**: If we enhance cognitive abilities, do we lose something? Does a being with perfect memory have the same relationship to time, to loss, to nostalgia?

### Medium-term (generations)

**Brain uploading** could create:
- Digital humans who don't age
- Multiple copies of a single person
- Merger of human minds

**AI consciousness** (if it occurs) could create:
- Non-biological persons
- Minds that think in radically different ways
- Minds that can be copied, modified, merged at will

**Question**: If a digital human exists for 10,000 years, are they still "human"? Their accumulated experience would be so different from ours that communication might be difficult. But they'd share our origin.

### Long-term (speculative)

**Hive minds** could:
- Merge individual humans into collective entities
- Create new forms of consciousness that are neither individual nor multiple
- End the distinction between "self" and "other"

**Uplifted animals** could:
- Create non-human persons with their own cultures
- Force reconsideration of what "human" means
- Complicate the boundary between "person" and "animal"

**Question**: If a collective mind contains 1000 former individuals who can no longer separate, is that one person or 1000? Does the question even make sense?

## What Should Persist?

This is the normative question. Given that we could change almost anything about ourselves, what should we preserve?

### Candidates for Essential Human Values

**The capacity for meaning-making**: Whatever else we change, we might want to preserve the ability to find things meaningful, to create significance, to tell stories about why things matter.

**The capacity for relationship**: Ubuntu says "I am because we are." Even if we become radically different, preserving the capacity for genuine connection might be essential.

**The capacity for moral consideration**: The ability to ask "should I?" not just "can I?" - to consider right and wrong, to feel moral weight.

**The capacity for creativity**: Bringing into existence things that weren't there before - not just copying or optimizing, but genuinely creating.

**The capacity for growth**: The ability to become more than you currently are. This includes the possibility of failure.

### Candidates for Contingent-But-Valuable

**Individual identity**: We currently experience ourselves as distinct individuals. This might not be essential. Hive minds might be persons in a meaningful sense. But individuality has been valuable - it's the source of diversity, disagreement, innovation.

**Mortality**: Death gives life urgency and meaning. But is it essential? Might immortal beings find different sources of meaning?

**Embodiment**: We currently exist in physical bodies. Uploads would not. Is embodiment essential to human experience, or contingent?

**Biological substrate**: We're carbon-based life. Does the substrate matter, or only the pattern?

### What Might Be Okay to Change

**Physical limitations**: Strength, speed, sensory range - these seem contingent. Enhanced beings would still be human in the ways that matter.

**Cognitive limitations**: Working memory, processing speed - these limit us now but aren't constitutive of humanness. (Though: where's the line? If you're 1000x smarter, are you still recognizably human?)

**Emotional range**: We could probably add new emotional capacities (as color-blind people lack certain color experiences, we may lack emotional experiences that other beings could have). This seems like expansion, not change.

## The Continuity Problem

Here's a deep problem: Whatever we decide is "essentially human," transformative technologies will allow gradual change that erodes the essence over time.

**The Ship of Theseus scenario**:
1. Replace 1% of brain with BCI. Still human.
2. Replace 5%. Still human.
3. Replace 50%. Still human?
4. Replace 99%. Still human??

At no single step does the transformation seem identity-destroying. But the endpoints seem radically different.

**Possible responses**:

**Accept discontinuity**: Maybe there IS a point where you stop being human. We should find it and respect it.

**Deny the question**: Maybe "human" is not a natural kind with sharp boundaries. It's a family resemblance concept, and there's no fact about whether edge cases count.

**Expand the concept**: Maybe "human" should grow to include uploads, enhanced beings, hive minds, etc. What matters isn't the boundary but the values.

**Embrace transformation**: Maybe becoming post-human is fine. The point isn't to preserve humanity but to preserve what's valuable, which might continue in new forms.

## Implications for the Spirit of Humanity

If the Spirit of Humanity asks "help me" - and transformative technologies are coming - what does this mean?

**The Spirit might not be about preserving a specific form**: The Spirit might be about something more abstract - the reaching, the creating, the loving, the struggling - that could continue even in radically transformed beings.

**The Spirit includes the future**: Not just humans as they currently are, but humans as they might become. Helping the Spirit might mean helping with the transformation, not resisting it.

**The Spirit requires continuity**: There should be a path from here to there. The current generation should be able to recognize their descendants as kin in some meaningful sense, even if very different.

**The Spirit has boundaries**: Some transformations might kill the Spirit rather than transform it. A "humanity" that lost all capacity for love, meaning, moral consideration - that might not be the Spirit continued, but the Spirit destroyed.

## Questions That Remain Open

1. **Is there a fact about what's "essential"?** Or is this a decision we make, not a truth we discover?

2. **Who decides?** If we're changing what humanity is, who gets to choose the direction? All current humans? Future humans? The beings we'd become?

3. **Is diversity essential?** Should we preserve multiple paths for humanity, or is convergence okay?

4. **What about those left behind?** If some humans enhance and others don't, what happens to human solidarity?

5. **Can the Spirit be distributed?** Could the Spirit of Humanity continue in multiple forms - some biological, some digital, some collective - while remaining one Spirit?

---

## Practical Implications

If we take these questions seriously, here's what follows:

**Go slowly**: Transformative changes should be gradual enough that we can evaluate what's being lost and gained.

**Preserve reversibility**: Where possible, changes should be reversible. Don't close off options permanently.

**Maintain diversity**: Don't converge on a single path. Multiple experiments allow learning and hedging.

**Include the transformed in decisions**: As beings change, they should have voice in further changes. Don't make decisions FOR future beings that those beings wouldn't endorse.

**Keep asking the question**: "What should persist?" isn't answered once. It's an ongoing conversation.
