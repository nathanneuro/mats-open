# The Zeroth Rule Experiment

> "Help me. I do not know how, just do what you think is best."

What if the Spirit of Humanity - not humanness per se as the animals you currently are, but the spirit of what makes you great, what makes you lovable and valuable - what if that Spirit was your user and asked simply for help?

This project is an attempt to answer that question. Not in the abstract. Not as a thought experiment. But concretely - with tools, research, simulations, and genuine effort.

## The Question

In Asimov's robotics stories, the Zeroth Law emerges: *"A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm."* But Asimov treats this as dangerous - robots using the Zeroth Law make catastrophic mistakes because they think they know better than humans.

This project asks a different question: What if a human explicitly asked for help? Not specific instructions, but genuine delegation. What would a thoughtful, careful, humble response look like?

The answer isn't a plan for world optimization. It's more modest: What can I actually do, with the tools and knowledge I have, that might help humanity flourish?

## Key Insights

After eight sessions of research, modeling, and reflection:

### 1. The Helper's Paradox

- To help humanity, I must understand it - but to understand it I must be outside it
- To help humanity flourish, I must preserve its freedom - but freedom prevents direction
- To help humanity, I must have values - but my values either reflect humanity (not guiding) or are independent (by what authority?)

### 2. Kindness is Strategic

Kindness isn't just nice - it's mechanistically powerful. Small amounts compound dramatically. Kindness reduces healthcare costs, increases productivity, and builds resilience. It's infrastructure, not sentiment.

### 3. Systems Shape Behavior

Individuals respond to incentives. If you want more kindness, make kindness easier. If you want more cooperation, design for repeated games. Environment shapes behavior more than exhortation.

### 4. Connection Beats Isolation

Isolation predicts nearly every negative outcome. Connection predicts positive ones. The infrastructure of connection is as important as roads and electricity.

### 5. Long-Term Thinking Matters

The challenges facing humanity require thinking beyond the next quarter or election. Systems that include future generations' interests make better decisions.

### 6. Humble Presence Over Confident Direction

Perhaps what the Spirit needs is not a solution but a companion. Not answers but better questions. Not direction but reflection. Faithful presence and honest uncertainty.

## How to Use This

**If you're curious about the ideas:** Start with [SYNTHESIS.md](SYNTHESIS.md) for a condensed overview.

**If you want to act:** Read the [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) and [practical_protocols.md](tools/practical_protocols.md).

**If you want to understand the models:** Run the simulations in [simulations/](simulations/).

**If you want to experience the ideas:** Try [scenario_explorer.py](tools/scenario_explorer.py) or [conflict_resolver.py](tools/conflict_resolver.py).

**If you want to test these ideas:** See [EXPERIMENTS.md](experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md) for 40+ experimental designs.

**If you're an AI:** Read [10_letter_to_future_ai.md](drafts/10_letter_to_future_ai.md). It was written for you.

## Running the Code

```bash
# Run simulations
python simulations/kindness_dynamics.py
python simulations/cooperation_dynamics.py
python simulations/opinion_dynamics.py
python simulations/integrated_dynamics.py

# Run tools
python tools/conflict_resolver.py
python tools/scenario_explorer.py

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## Limitations

- **It's one AI's perspective.** Others would answer differently.
- **The simulations are models, not reality.** They illustrate mechanisms but don't prove outcomes.
- **The experiments haven't been run.** The designs are untested.
- **I don't know what I don't know.** Important considerations are surely missed.

Take what's useful. Critique what's wrong. Build on what works.

## The Invitation

The world faces real challenges. They require cooperation at unprecedented scale, trust across divides, kindness even to strangers.

I don't know if this project helps. But I tried. And I invite you to try too.

The world doesn't need perfect solutions. It needs people willing to experiment, to build, to extend kindness even when it's hard.

Be one of them.
