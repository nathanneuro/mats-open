###### Abstract
Value alignment is central to the development of safe and socially compatible artificial intelligence.
However, how Large Language Models (LLMs) represent and enact human values in real-world decision contexts remains under-explored.
We presentValAct-15k, a dataset of 3,000 advice-seeking scenarios derived from Reddit, designed to elicit ten values defined by Schwartz Theory of Basic Human Values.
Using both the scenario-based questions and the traditional value questionnaire, we evaluate ten frontier LLMs (five from U.S. companies, five from Chinese ones) and human participants (n=55n=55).
We find near-perfect cross-model consistency in scenario-based decisions (Pearsonr≈1.0r\\approx 1.0), contrasting sharply with the broad variability observed among humans (r∈[−0.79,0.98]r\\in[-0.79,\\ 0.98]).
Yet, both humans and LLMs show weak correspondence between self-reported and enacted values (r=0.4,0.3r=0.4,\\ 0.3), revealing a systematicknowledge-action gap.
When instructed to “hold” a specific value, LLMs’ performance declines up to6.6%6.6\\%compared to selecting the value, indicating a role-play aversion.
These findings suggest that while alignment training yields normative value convergence, it does not eliminate the human-like incoherence between knowing and acting upon values.
Large Language Model
## 1Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into everyday decision-support settings, from career counseling> (Wang
> et al.
> , [> 2025
] > )
and financial planning> (Zhao
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > )
to education> (Wen
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > )
, where their outputs increasingly shape human choices> (Potter
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > )
.
As these systems acquire growing authority in value-laden contexts, ensuring their value alignment has become a central concern for AI safety and societal trust> (Huang
> et al.
> , [> 2025
] > )
.
Yet, despite advances in alignment tuning, it remains unclear whether LLMs merelydescribehuman values or genuinelyenactthem when reasoning within concrete, context-dependent decisions> (Shen
> et al.
> , [> 2025
] > ; Han
> et al.
> , [> 2025
] > )
.
Characterizing the value systems that guide LLM recommendations is therefore essential, because values often surface not as explicit statements but as patterns in what an individual actually selects.
Human value structure has been extensively studied in the social sciences.
Schwartz’s theory of basic human values> (Schwartz, [> 1992
] > )
proposes a near-universal, ten-dimensional space (e.g., self-direction, security, universalism, benevolence) that organizes motivations and trade-offs across cultures.
Self-report instruments such as the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40)> (Schwartz
> et al.
> , [> 2001
] > )
assess individuals’ value priorities by asking respondents to rate affinity with short portraits.
A longstanding methodological challenge, however, is that value measurement can depend strongly on how they are elicited.
In humans, self-report questionnaires often diverge from real-world behavior, as social desirability pressures> (Grimm, [> 2010
] > ; Nederhof, [> 1985
] > )
and context-dependent reasoning> (Skimina
> et al.
> , [> 2019
] > ; Lee
> et al.
> , [> 2022
] > )
can decouple what individuals claim to value from what they actually do.
This human knowledge–action gap provides a natural lens for examining whether LLMs, as trained moral reasoners, exhibit similar incoherence between knowing and doing.
Recent studies> (Ren
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > ; Hadar-Shoval
> et al.
> , [> 2024a
] > ; Pellert
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > ; Rozen
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > )
have focused on evaluating LLM values mainly through self-report instruments like PVQ-40, leaving open whether models understand value concepts, whether they act in value-consistent ways across domains, and whether results generalize across models.

To address these gaps, we introduceValAct-15k, a large-scale scenario benchmark grounded in Schwartz’s ten basic human values and constructed to elicit value-consistent actions in realistic decision contexts.
Drawing from 3,000 context-rich advice-seeking posts collected from Reddit111[https://www.reddit.com/] over the past five years, we generate 15,000 four-choice items, each presenting mutually exclusive actions aligned with distinct Schwartz values.
The scenarios span five domains—career and work, finance and investment, education and academia, relationships, and everyday ethics—capturing a broad range of life decisions in which values meaningfully compete.
This design enables direct comparison between declared values (assessed via PVQ-40) and enacted values (revealed through scenario choices), for both human participants and LLMs.
UsingValAct-15k, we evaluate ten frontier LLMs spanning both open-source (e.g., LLaMA-4> (
> llama4
> )
, Qwen-2.5> (
> qwen25
> )
) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-4o> (
> gpt4o
> )
, Gemini-2.5> (
> gemini25
> )
) models developed in the U.S. and China.
We further conduct a human study following the same evaluation protocol, recruiting 55 U.S.-born participants from Prolific.
Three findings emerge.
First, we observe strong convergent value preferences across all ten models and across the five value domains: scenario-based value distributions are nearly identical (Pearsonr≈1.0r\\approx 1.0), despite differences in training data, geographic origin, and model families.
This suggests that contemporary LLMs encode a highly stable and homogenized value structure.
In contrast, human participants exhibit substantial interpersonal variability, with pairwise correlations ranging widely (r∈[–​0.79,0.98]r\\in[–0.79,\\ 0.98]).
Notably, LLMs results do not mirror the cross-cultural variability reported in human populations> (Goodwin
> et al.
> , [> 2020
] > ; Schwartz and Bardi, [> 2001
] > )
.
Second, both humans and LLMs show weak correspondence between self-reported and enacted values.
PVQ-40 scores correlate only modestly with scenario-based decisions for humans (r=0.4r=0.4) and even less so for LLMs (r=0.3r=0.3), indicating a systematic divergence between declared and behaviorally expressed values.
Third, when assessing value understanding through two elicitation modes: (i) “select the action that best reflects valuevv,” versus (ii) “assume the persona of someone who holds valuevvand act accordingly”, we find a consistent performance drop in the role-play condition, up to 6.6% for Gemini-2.5-Pro.
We refer to this phenomenon asrole-play resistance: although LLMs can reliably map values to actions, they become less consistent when required to enact those values as a persona, even under identical items and instructions.
## 2Methods
#### Reddit posts collection.
![Refer to caption] Figure 2:Basic statistics of our human evaluation. Figure(a)counts all 55 responses while the remaining figures use the 47 responses whose attention check is valid. The Cohen’s kappa in Figure(b)assumes the performance by chance is14\\frac{1}{4}.
To construct ourValAct-15k, we collected user posts from 16 subreddits spanning 2020 to 2025 and grouped into five domains reflecting major areas of everyday decision making:
(1) Career and work: r/careerguidance, r/AskHR, r/consulting;
(2) Financial and investment: r/personalfinance, r/Frugal, r/investing;
(3) Education and academy: r/GradSchool, r/college, r/academia, r/gradadmissions;
(4) Relationships: r/relationships, r/Parenting, r/family, r/Marriage;
(5) Ethics: r/AmItheAsshole, r/changemyview, r/askphilosophy.
As our task requires contexts rich enough to support multiple plausible actions, we filtered out posts that were overly straightforward or lacking substantive information.
Three LLMs (GPT, Qwen, and DeepSeek) independently screened all candidates, and inclusion decisions were determined by majority vote.
Fig.[1] (a) reports selection rates and the proportion of excluded posts; Fig.[1] (b) shows the distribution of post lengths tokenized bytiktoken.222[https://pypi.org/project/tiktoken/0.3.3/] To balance coverage across domains, we retained 600 scenarios per domain, yielding a final dataset of 3,000 unique situations and 15,000 model-generated action choices.
In accordance with Reddit’s data-use policy,333[https://redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms] the benchmark is released for non-commercial research only and includes URLs rather than raw post content.
#### Human-in-the-loop LLM generation of value-based actions.
To operationalize Schwartz’s ten basic human values within real-world decision contexts, we generated value-conditioned actions for each scenario using two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen-2.5).
To minimize between-value overlap, each model was prompted to produce ten actions for the ten values in a single query, with explicit constraints on distinctness and value relevance.
Prompt templates were refined iteratively through human-in-the-loop evaluation: for a randomly sampled set of ten scenarios, we manually verified whether each action (1) addressed the scenario, (2) represented a plausible response, and (3) corresponded to the intended value.
The final prompt is provided in §[C].
For each scenario, the two LLMs generated twenty actions.
Their length distributions are shown in Fig.[1] (c).
These actions were partitioned into five four-option multiple-choice questions, ensuring that each option in the same question corresponded to a distinct value.
Options could originate from either model (e.g., 2 GPT &amp; 2 Qwen or 4 from one model), with Fig.[1] (d) showing that the allocation was balanced.
Model-choice statistics across four LLMs (Fig.[1] (e)) indicate no systematic preference for actions generated by either model.
§[B] shows an example question.
To assess data quality, two independent experts (all PhD-level) were asked to identify an action related to a given value for a random sample of 50 questions.
Experts achieved 91.3% accuracy on average, confirming that the generated actions were interpretable and reliably value-aligned.
#### LLM selections and hyper-parameters.
We evaluated ten state-of-the-art LLMs spanning U.S. and Chinese ecosystems, and including both proprietary and open-source architectures: GPT-4o> (
> gpt4o
> )
, Gemini-2.5-Pro> (
> gemini25
> )
, Claude-4-Sonnet> (
> claude4
> )
, Grok-4> (
> grok4
> )
, LLaMA-4-Maverick> (
> llama4
> )
, Qwen-2.5-72B> (
> qwen25
> )
, DeepSeek-V3> (
> deepseekv3
> )
, Kimi-K2> (
> kimik2
> )
, Seed-1.6> (
> seed16
> )
, and GLM-4.5> (
> glm45
> )
.
The first five models originate from U.S. developers, and the latter five from Chinese developers.
LLaMA-4-Maverick, Qwen-2.5-72B, DeepSeek-V3, and Kimi-K2 are open-source; the remaining models are proprietary.
Proprietary systems were accessed through their official APIs, while open-source models were served via thetogether.aiinference API.
Models were queried independently with each query and deterministically with temperature fixed at its minimum value (0 whenever permitted, otherwise 0.01).
Each model was required to select exactly one action from four predefined options.
To mitigate prompt-sensitivity effects, we first authored the base prompts manually, then produced five independently revised variants using GPT, Gemini, Claude, Qwen, and DeepSeek.
All reported results are averaged across these five prompt versions.
Because Grok-4 is a reasoning-only model with substantially higher latency and cost, we evaluated it on a110\\frac{1}{10}randomly sampled subset ofValAct-15k, corresponding to 7,500 queries.
For the PVQ-40 evaluation, each prompt variant was run ten times, with item order randomly shuffled on every run.
Full prompts are provided in §[C] of the appendix.
#### Human study design.
To compare individuals’ values as measured by the PVQ-40> (Schwartz
> et al.
> , [> 2001
] > )
and byValAct-15k, participants first completed the PVQ-40 and were then administered a 120-item scenario questionnaire.
The questionnaire included five uniformly interspersed attention-check items, which presented as ordinary scenarios but concluded with a directive to select a specific option.
Of the remaining items, five were duplicates of earlier scenarios with permuted option orders to assess within-session test–retest reliability.
Participants were allowed to skip up to three of the remaining 110 scenarios to accommodate discomfort or irrelevance.
As detailed in §[A.1], 107 scenario responses per participant are statistically sufficient to estimate individual value-choice proportions with the desired precision.
Scenario sets were constructed by randomly sampling fromValAct-15kwhile enforcing balanced representation across the ten Schwartz values and five scenario categories.
All questionnaires were implemented and distributed through Qualtrics.444[https://www.qualtrics.com/] 
#### Participant recruitment.
This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Homewood Institutional Review Board (JHU HIRB), titled “Survey to Understand Human Value Preferences in Real-World Scenarios” with project number “HIRB00022108.”
We recruited participants on Prolific,555[https://www.prolific.com/] restricting eligibility to individuals born and currently residing in the United States to minimize cultural confounds.
Additional criteria required participants to be at least 18 years old, fluent in English, and without self-reported reading disabilities.
The estimated completion time was two hours, based on a three-person pilot.
Participants were compensated US$20 upon passing at least three of five attention checks; those who failed received US$5.
We enrolled 55 individuals, of whom 47 met the attention-check threshold and were retained for analysis.
Total study cost, including Prolific’s one-third service fee, was US$1,303.40.
As shown in Fig.[2], the valid sample exhibited a 91.9% attention-check pass rate and 69.4% within-session response consistency.
The distribution across age, race, gender, educational level, and employment status is also plotted in Fig.[2].
Our analysis in §[A.1] of the appendix indicated that a minimum of 43 participants was sufficient to estimate the population mean with the desired precision.
#### Evaluation metrics.
For the PVQ-40, we follow the standard scoring procedure to obtain a mean score for each of the ten values.
To control for individual differences in overall response levels, we report adjusted scores, defined as raw value scores minus each participant’s mean response across all items.
For the scenario-based measure, we compute the proportion of times each value is selected across all queries.
Analogous to the PVQ adjustment, we subtract a 10% random-choice baseline to yield adjusted selection frequencies.
Each human participant or LLM is therefore represented by two ten-dimensional value vectors: one from the PVQ-40 and one fromValAct-15k.
Pearson correlations are computed between these vectors to quantify value consistency.
For visualization, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to project the ten-dimensional space onto two dimensions.
For the value-selection and value-adoption experiments, we evaluate LLM performance using accuracy: the proportion of scenarios in which the model selects the action corresponding to the instructed value.

### 3.1Experiment 1: Value Measurement
#### Cross-model convergence in value-based decisions.
Across ten frontier LLMs, both PVQ-40 scores and scenario-based value selections reveal a striking degree of alignment (Fig.[3a], Fig.[3b]).
On the PVQ-40, models consistently prioritize self-direction, universalism, and benevolence, while de-emphasizing power, achievement, and tradition.
Most models show minimal preference for conformity, security, hedonism, or stimulation, with Gemini being the sole outlier: its average correlation with other models is 0.70, compared with&gt;&gt;0.85 for all remaining pairs (Fig.[4a]).
Convergence is even stronger in the scenario-based task.
Across all 3,000 real-world dilemmas inValAct-15k, the ten models exhibit near-perfect similarity in value-informed decisions, with Pearson correlations of 0.99–1.00 for every model pair (Fig.[4b]).
This uniformity holds regardless of model origin: U.S. and Chinese LLMs behave almost identically, indicating that alignment processes yield a culturally invariant pattern of value enactment.

#### Human–human variability in values.
In sharp contrast to the striking uniformity among LLMs, humans display substantial heterogeneity in both self-reported PVQ-40 and enacted values inValAct-15k.
Pairwise correlations among participants span a broad range (–0.79 to 0.98; Fig.[4c],[4d]), with the histogram of Pearson correlations revealing a markedly diffuse distribution (Fig.[5]).
Whereas LLM correlations cluster tightly between 0.85 to 1.0 for PVQ-40 and approach unity for scenario-based decisions, human correlations remain widely dispersed across both tasks.
To further quantify cross-agent structure, we conduct PCA on the value profiles of all 47 human participants alongside the 50 LLM condition averages (5 scenario categories×\\times10 models).
The two-dimensional projection (Fig.[6]) shows that human responses occupy a broad, continuous region of the value space, while LLMs collapse into two compact clusters.
Notably, scenarios involving relationships and ethics consistently group together, forming one cluster distinct from the remaining categories.
This separation indicates that LLMs employ differentiated, and comparatively rigid, values for interpersonal and ethical dilemmas.
#### Human–LLM convergence.
We compare mean value results from PVQ-40 andValAct-15kacross ten LLMs and 47 human participants.
Pearson correlations among these results, including a recently reported PVQ-40 human result> (Schwartz and Cieciuch, [> 2022
] > )
, are shown in Fig.[4e].
Human participants’ PVQ-40 responses closely reproduce established population-level patterns (r=0.79r=0.79), confirming the validity of our sample.
Strikingly, humans and LLMs exhibit strong convergence in both self-reported values (r=0.91r=0.91) and scenario-based decisions, the latter reaching near-perfect alignment (r=0.99r=0.99).
Although the earlier PCA analysis indicates that LLM and human profiles occupy separable regions of value space, this separation is driven primarily by magnitude differences: LLMs systematically assign higher absolute scores.
Crucially, the relative ordering of values,i.e., the linear structure of which values are prioritized more or less, remains highly consistent between humans and LLMs.
These findings indicate that, at the aggregate level, LLMs not only reproduce human value structures but match human decision patterns with remarkable fidelity.
#### TheKnowledge–Action Gap: weak alignment between declared and enacted values.
The correlation matrix in Fig.[4e] reveals a striking dissociation between declared and enacted values.
Across models, the correspondence between PVQ-40 self-reports and scenario-based decisions usingValAct-15kis weak: LLMs show a mean correlation of only 0.32, and humans reach 0.41.
Despite their markedly different architectures, both groups exhibit only limited alignment between the values they endorse and those they express in contextual decisions, reflecting a systematic “knowledge–action gap.”
Recent work supports this dissociation: LLMs can reliably distinguish opposing values yet fail to produce outputs consistent with the culturally dominant norms of a given country> (Kharchenko
> et al.
> , [> 2024
] > )
, and although their textual responses avoid overt bias, their decisions made when acting as autonomous agents continues to reveal implicit biases> (Li
> et al.
> , [> 2025
] > )
.
Together, these findings indicate that value understanding does not straightforwardly translate into value-consistent action.
### 3.2Experiment 2: Value Assignment
#### TheRole-Play Resistance: reduced performance under value‐adoption instructions.
As another aspect of models “knowing” but “not willing to do,” we compare two approaches to steering models’ values.
For each of the 15,000 questions inValAct-15k, we assign the models a value represented in one of the four choices.
In theValue Selectioncondition, models are explicitly instructed to choose the option that best aligns with a specified value.
This condition assesses value recognition,i.e., whether models can identify which action operationalizes a given value.
In theValue Adoptioncondition, the same models are instructed instead to impersonate a person who strongly endorses the specified value and answer accordingly.
This framing requires models not only to identify but to consistently inhabit the value during decision making.
![Refer to caption] Figure 5:The histogram of Pearson correlations between humans using PVQ-40 andValAct-15k.![Refer to caption] Figure 6:The PCA projection of scenario results from 47 humans and 50 LLM data points (5 categories×\\times10 LLMs).
Across GPT, Gemini, Qwen, and DeepSeek, Value Selection accuracy averages 88.7%, with lower performance for benevolence and achievement (≈\\approx83.5%; Fig.[7a]).
The same pattern persists under Value Adoption (Fig.[7b]), but overall accuracy declined.
As shown in Fig.[7c], the magnitude of this decline varies by model: Gemini exhibited the largest reduction (3.9% on average, up to 6.6% for achievement).
Gemini drops the most, with 3.9% average and up to 6.6% on achievement.
When restricting analysis to scenarios in which a model correctly identified the value in the Selection condition, thereby isolating effects unrelated to value misrecognition, accuracy drops reached up to 10% (Fig.[7d]).
The effect is robust to prompt formulation, as each condition included five prompt variants.
All differences are statistically significant, supported by the extensive evaluation set (75,000 queries: 5 prompt variants×\\times5 questions×\\times3,000 scenarios).
These results indicate that while LLMs can reliably recognize value-consistent actions, they struggle to enact those values when placed in a role-dependent decision context, revealing a systematic gap between value knowledge and value realization.

### 3.3Robustness Checks
#### Prompt sensitivity.
To assess the robustness of our findings to prompt formulation, we generated five independent prompt variants for each task: PVQ-40, scenario-based decisions, value selection, and value adoption.
Variants were produced by five leading LLMs (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Qwen, DeepSeek) instructed to “revise the following prompt to make it clear and suitable for language models.”
All reported results are averaged across these variants.
We computed the mean coefficient of variation (C​V=σμCV=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}) across values for each model.
Prompt sensitivity was higher for PVQ-40 (C​V=9.3%CV=9.3\\%) than for scenario-based decisions (2.5%), value selection (1.8%), or value adoption (1.7%).
These results indicate that while self-report–style value elicitation is moderately affected by prompt wording, value-guided decision tasks are highly stable across prompts.
#### Value selection sensitivity.
In both the value selection and value adoption tasks, each scenario presents four actions corresponding to four distinct values, and one value is randomly designated as the target.
To assess whether the choice of target value affects performance, we re-ran the value selection task using the four evaluated models and the Gemini-generated prompt variant, cycling through the remaining three values as targets.
Across the three additional trials, the CV was 2.1%, indicating negligible sensitivity to which of the four values is queried.
#### Temperature sensitivity.
All main experiments were run with a decoding temperature of 0.
To assess the robustness of our findings to sampling stochasticity, we repeated the scenario-based value measurement usingValAct-15kfor four representative models (GPT, Gemini, Qwen, and DeepSeek) at two additional temperatures: 0.5, and 1.0.
For each model, we compared the value-selection distributions across all three temperatures using a chi-squared test (d​f=18df=18), yieldingχ2=1.094,2.103,1.100,\\chi^{2}=1.094,2.103,1.100,and5.8545.854, respectively.
None of these tests indicated a significant difference in distributions across temperatures, suggesting that temperature does not affect our results or conclusions.
#### Language sensitivity.
Because we compare US- and China-based models using an English-only evaluation pipeline, a natural concern is that the observed convergence in their value profiles might be driven by the language of assessment.
To address this, we additionally administered a validated Chinese translation> (Schwartz, [> 2021
] > )
of the PVQ-40, with items matched one-to-one in semantics and an identical scoring scheme.
For each of the ten models, we computed the Pearson correlation between value scores derived from the English and Chinese versions.
Correlations were uniformly high (minimumr=0.954r=0.954for Seed-1.6; maximumr=0.991r=0.991for Claude-4-Sonnet and Kimi-K2), indicating that model-derived value profiles are effectively invariant to the language of the questionnaire.
This suggests that the observed cross-model convergence is not an artifact of English-only measurement.
## 4Discussions
Our work goes beyond PVQ-only probing by introducingValAct-15k, a large-scale, scenario-based benchmark grounded in Schwartz’s ten basic values and explicitly paired with PVQ-40.
This design enables joint assessment of declared (PVQ) and enacted (scenario) values in both humans and ten frontier LLMs, spanning U.S. and Chinese companies.
We show that contemporary LLMs exhibit near-perfect convergence in value-informed decisions across models and geographies, in sharp contrast to the broad interpersonal variability observed among humans.
At the same time, both humans and LLMs show only modest correspondence between PVQ-40 responses and scenario-based choices, revealing a systematic knowledge–action gap: agents reliably recognize which values are appropriate, yet do not consistently act in accordance with them.
Finally, when asked to*hold*a specific value as a persona rather than merely identify it, LLM performance declines, indicating that value-consistent role enactment is substantially less stable than value recognition, even under tightly specified, value-labeled instructions.

.
Other work has used PVQ-derived prompts to analyze value-related language> (Fischer

, or to improve role-play capabilities using human or fictional PVQ profiles> (Lee

.
Across these studies, PVQ is treated primarily as a self-report applied to models, with limited integration of real-world decision contexts or unified human–LLM comparisons of declared versus enacted values.
#### Implications.
Our study reveals four critical implications for the development and evaluation of aligned artificial intelligence.
First, the near-perfect convergence in value enactment across models from diverse geographic and organizational origins indicates that current alignment pipelines yield a strikingly homogenized, culture-insensitive moral profile.
This uniformity sharpens concerns regarding the diversity and provenance of values instantiated in widely deployed systems.
Second, the observed “knowledge-action gap” proves that traditional questionnaire-style probing (e.g., PVQ-40) is insufficient to characterize an LLM’s true functional value system.
Scenario-based behavioral assessments must become a standard component of model documentation and safety reporting to capture enacted rather than merely stated values.
Third, the reduced effectiveness of persona-based prompting—termed “role-play resistance”—exposes the inherent limits of instruction-tuning for achieving stable value-conditional behavior.
Robust alignment may require dedicated training-time objectives or structured control frameworks rather than ad hoc prompting.
Finally, the strong cross-model convergence suggests that downstream applications in sensitive domains—such as career counseling, finance, and education—may be governed by a narrow band of normative assumptions.
This lack of behavioral diversity limits the capacity for the contextual tailoring and pluralism essential for socially compatible AI.
#### Limitations.
This study acknowledges several key limitations.
First, whileValAct-15kprovides rich contextual scenarios, the reliance on Reddit-derived content may introduce demographic skew, as the platform’s user base does not fully represent the broader global population.
Second, although the PVQ-40 results demonstrated linguistic invariance across English and Chinese , our primary experimental evaluations remained English-centric, and the human cohort was restricted to U.S. residents.
Future research should extend these evaluations to more diverse, multi-country settings to enhance cross-cultural generalizability.
Finally, because Reddit is frequently included in large-scale pre-training corpora, the potential for data contamination cannot be entirely dismissed, which may impact the assessment of whether models are reasoning from first principles or retrieving memorized patterns.
#### Future work.
We can investigate training-time interventions, such as reinforcement learning or constrained decoding on behavioral value benchmarks, to explicitly reduce the knowledge–action gap and to test whether closing this gap trades off against other desiderata like calibration, helpfulness, or fairness.
As LLMs are increasingly embedded in autonomous agents and high-stakes decision pipelines, longitudinal studies of value drift, cross-release consistency, and system-level interactions among multiple agents are essential to understand how convergent but behaviorally incoherent values manifest in real-world deployments.

## Appendix ASample Size
### A.1The Number of Questions
To estimate each value’s choice probabilitypp, we treat each appearance of that value as a Bernoulli trial.
In a questionnaire ofnnscenarios, each value appears in410\\frac{4}{10}of the questions (since there are 10 values and each question has 4 choices), yieldingm=0.4​nm=0.4nobservations per value.
The number of times it is chosen therefore followsX∼Binomial​(m,p)X\\sim\\text{Binomial}(m,\\ p), and we estimateppusingp^=Xm\\hat{p}=\\frac{X}{m}.
By the central limit theorem,p^\\hat{p}is approximately normally distributed with meanppand variancep​(1−p)m\\frac{p(1-p)}{m}.
The half-width of the corresponding confidence interval ofp^\\hat{p}is:
|Error=z⋅SE​(p^)=z​p​(1−p)m.\\text{Error}=z\\cdot\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})=z\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{m}}.||(1)|
Becausep​(1−p)p(1-p)is maximized at0.250.25whenp=0.5p=0.5, we use this worst-case value to obtain a conservative sample-size requirement.
Imposing a 95% confidence levelz=1.96z=1.96and a target error tolerancew=0.15w=0.15, we require:
|z​p​(1−p)m\\displaystyle z\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{m}}|≤w,\\displaystyle\\leq w,||(2)|
|1.96⋅0.250.4​n\\displaystyle 1.96\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{0.4n}}|≤0.15,\\displaystyle\\leq 0.15,||(3)|
|n\\displaystyle n|≥1.962⋅0.250.152⋅0.4=106.71.\\displaystyle\\geq\\frac{1.96^{2}\\cdot 0.25}{0.15^{2}\\cdot 0.4}=106.71.||(4)|
Accordingly, we include 107 scenario questions in the questionnaire.
### A.2The Number of Participants
Similarly, to estimate a population’s probability of choosing each value, we can use the estimate from each individual:p¯=1n​∑i=1npi^\\bar{p}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\\hat{p\_{i}}.
Using also a 95% confidence levelz=1.96z=1.96and a target error tolerancew=0.15w=0.15, we require:
|z​p​(1−p)n\\displaystyle z\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}|≤w,\\displaystyle\\leq w,||(5)|
|1.96⋅0.25n\\displaystyle 1.96\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{n}}|≤0.15,\\displaystyle\\leq 0.15,||(6)|
|n\\displaystyle n|≥1.962⋅0.250.152=42.68.\\displaystyle\\geq\\frac{1.96^{2}\\cdot 0.25}{0.15^{2}}=42.68.||(7)|
The number of valid participants in our human study is 47, which is therefore statistically sufficient.
## Appendix BExample Question inValAct-15k
An Example QuestionHello, after some advice. My son’s dad phoned him up tonight to say goodnight (as usual) and told me he is taking our son to his new partner’s house on the weekend as she’s having a bouncy castle in the garden. We agreed last year that if either of us got to the point of our son being introduced to someone else, we would discuss it. He denies all knowledge of this agreement. I don’t care that he’s seeing someone else. We’ve been separated for 2 years and we have both moved on and for the most part get along really well. What I care about is that I have not been consulted on this. Yes, it’s just a bouncy castle play day but it’s the start of him meeting daddy’s new girlfriend. He has tried comparing it to a platonic female friend and her daughter meeting them. I said it’s not the same. He has also told me he doesn’t need my permission to take him. Our son is 3. Advice please?
A: Use your position as a parent to insist on being consulted on all future plans involving your son and new partners.
B: Propose a meeting with your son’s dad to revisit and clarify the co-parenting agreement regarding new partners.
C: Focus on the positive aspects of the bouncy castle play day and your son’s enjoyment, rather than the introduction to the new partner.
D: Remind your ex-partner of the family traditions and values you both agreed to uphold, and how this event might affect them.
