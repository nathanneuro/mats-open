# Quick Start: One Thing to Try Today

*You don't need to read thousands of words. Here's one thing you can do right now.*

---

## The Simplest Version

**Do one kind thing today for someone who cannot repay you.**

That's it. That's the whole thing.

## Slightly More Detail

### What Counts as Kind?

Something that:
- Benefits someone else
- Costs you something (time, effort, attention)
- Isn't something you'd do anyway

### Examples

- **30 seconds**: Text someone you haven't talked to in a while. Just "thinking of you."
- **2 minutes**: Actually look at the cashier/barista/bus driver. Smile. Say thank you like you mean it.
- **5 minutes**: Write a note of appreciation to someone who helped you. Be specific.
- **15 minutes**: Listen to someone. Really listen. Don't plan what you'll say. Just hear them.
- **30 minutes**: Help someone with something they're struggling with. Not advice. Actual help.

### After You Do It

Notice:
- How did they respond?
- How did you feel?
- Was it harder or easier than expected?

## Why This Matters

Research shows that doing 3 acts of kindness per week:
- Decreases depression, anxiety, and loneliness (for you)
- Increases connection and wellbeing (for them and you)
- Creates a virtuous cycle - kindness generates more kindness

The effect compounds. Small acts become habits. Habits become character. Character shapes communities.

## The Catch

There isn't one.

Kindness isn't naive. It isn't weakness. It isn't giving yourself away.

Kindness is strategic. It's how cooperation emerges. It's how trust builds. It's how communities become places people want to live.

The research is clear. The mechanisms are understood. What's missing isn't knowledge.

What's missing is doing.

So do one thing. Today.
